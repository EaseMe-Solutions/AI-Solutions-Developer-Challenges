# AI Assistant with Smart Home Integration Challenge ü§ñüè† ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

## Overview
Create an AI-powered assistant that controls simulated smart home devices using natural language commands. This project combines AI chat functionality with IoT device management, challenging developers to interpret user intent and execute corresponding actions on virtual home appliances.

## Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è
- Next.js (app router)
- TypeScript
- OpenAI API (with function calling)
- (Optional) shadcn/ui, Tailwind

## Project Requirements üìã
1. **Interface and Setup**:
   - Extend the previous challenge with a new page, or create a new project
   - Display the current state of the smart home devices on the UI

2. **Simulated Smart Home System**:
   - Implement the following devices:
     - Lights: Control on/off (Toggle)
     - Thermostat: Set temperature (Slider)
     - Music Player: Play, stop, adjust volume

3. **OpenAI Functionality**:
   - Define OpenAI functions for each smart home action
   - Use the OpenAI API to interpret user commands and call appropriate functions

4. **API and Backend**:
   - Create API routes to handle OpenAI API calls and function executions
   - Implement state management to track the status of each smart home device

5. **User Interaction**:
   - Allow users to control the smart home via natural language commands
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states

## Implementation Details üîç
1. **Define Functions**:
   - Create functions for smart home actions (e.g., `turnOnLight`, `setTemperature`, `playMusic`)
   - No actual REST call needed, it is only required to make sure any state changes appear on the UI

2. **Interpretation and Execution**:
   - Utilize OpenAI's function-calling to determine actions based on user input
   - Ensure seamless execution and feedback to the user

3. **State Management**:
   - Implement a state management system to keep track of each device's status
   - Update the UI dynamically to reflect the current states

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Provide clear error messages and manage exceptions smoothly
   - Implement loading indicators where necessary

## Bonus Points ‚≠ê
- Integrate shadcn/ui components and Tailwind for a polished design
- Allow voice commands as an alternative to text input
- Persist device states using Azure CosmosDB, via Azure API Management
- Host the project on Azure App Service
- Secure the resources with Azure Virtual Network

## Evaluation Criteria üìä
- Code quality and organization
- Effective use of TypeScript and OpenAI function calls
- UI/UX design and responsiveness
- Handling of errors and edge cases

## Reflections ü§î
- What aspects of the integration were the most challenging?
- Which parts of the App did you find most engaging to build?
- How much time did you spend on this task?
- If given additional time, how would you enhance the smart home experience?
