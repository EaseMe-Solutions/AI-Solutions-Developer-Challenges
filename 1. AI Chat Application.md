# AI Chat Application Challenge: Full-Stack Coding 🤖💬 ★☆☆☆

## Overview
Build a simple yet functional AI chat application using Next.js and the OpenAI API. This project focuses on creating a user-friendly interface for interacting with ChatGPT, implementing real-time response streaming, and dynamically generating conversation titles. It serves as an entry point to full-stack development with AI integration.

## Technology Stack 🛠️
- Next.js (app router)
- TypeScript
- shadcn/ui, Tailwind
- OpenAI API (Chat Completion)

## Project Requirements 📋
- Create a basic UI for chatting with the OpenAI Platform using chat completion.
- Implement the following chat flow:
  1. User sends an initial message
  2. Display (Stream) the response from ChatGPT
  3. Automatically send the recent ChatGPT response back to the API
  4. Request a max 75-character long title for the conversation based on ChatGPT's initial response
  5. Display (Stream) the generated title on the page

## Implementation Details 🔍
- Set up a Next.js project with TypeScript.
- Create an API route to handle communication with the OpenAI API.
- Implement a chat interface using React components.
- Display Assistant message streaming.
- Ensure proper error handling and loading states.
- Opcionally, integrate shadcn/ui components and Tailwind for styling.
  
## Bonus Points ⭐
- Save conversation history on Azure CosmosDB (be able to reset the conversation)
- Host the project on Azure App Service

## Evaluation Criteria 📊
