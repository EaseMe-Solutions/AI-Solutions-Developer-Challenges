## Overview
Create a system to train and deploy a Language Model (LLM) using private documents, ensuring data privacy throughout the process. While Azure AI Studio and GPT fine-tuning are recommended, alternative approaches are welcome.

## Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è
- Python *
- Azure AI Studio *
- GPT model for fine-tuning *
- Azure Virtual Machine (for deployment) *
- Azure API Management or FastAPI/Flask for API development *

**\* Preferred, but not required**

## Project Requirements üìã

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Devise a method to ingest and preprocess private documents.
   - Ensure data handling respects privacy concerns.

2. **LLM Training**:
   - Leverage Azure AI Studio for model training and fine-tuning.
   - Aim to fine-tune a GPT model on the private document dataset.
   - Alternatively, select another open-source LLM of your choice, as a starting point (e.g., BERT, T5).

3. **Model Deployment**:
   - Deploy the trained model on an Azure Virtual Machine or equivalent environment.
   - Create an API for model interaction using Azure API Management, FastAPI, Flask, or similar tools.

4. **Solution Presentation**:
   - Export the configured Azure VM as a template to facilitate easy reproduction of the solution.

## Implementation Details üîç

1. **Data Handling**:
   - Establish a pipeline for document ingestion and preprocessing.
   - Consider data anonymization or pseudonymization techniques where appropriate.

2. **Model Training**:
   - With Azure AI Studio:
     - Utilize its features for efficient data handling and model training.
     - Explore the platform's fine-tuning capabilities for GPT models.
   - For alternative approaches:
     - Apply suitable training techniques and safeguards against overfitting.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Azure VM setup:
     - Configure the VM with necessary settings.
     - Install dependencies and deploy the model.
   - API setup:
     - If using Azure API Management, configure policies for effective management.
     - For FastAPI/Flask, deploy on your chosen platform.
   - Provide clear setup and access instructions for the deployed model.

4. **VM Template Export**:
   - After successful deployment, export the Azure VM configuration as a template.
   - Include instructions on how to use the exported template to recreate the environment.

## Bonus Features ‚≠ê
- Implement a system to monitor and detect unusual usage patterns.
- Develop a strategy for continuous learning.
- Integrate Azure Cognitive Services for complementary NLP tasks.

## Evaluation Criteria üìä
- Model quality and output relevance
- Suitability of the deployment approach
- Effective use of Azure services (if applicable)
- API design and functionality
- Code clarity, structure, and documentation
- Thoughtful handling of private data
- Ease of solution reproduction using the exported VM template

## Reflections ü§î
- What challenges arose when working with private documents?
- How did you balance model performance with data privacy concerns?
- If you used Azure AI Studio, how did it compare to other methods you've encountered?
